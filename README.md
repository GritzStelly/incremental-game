# incremental-game
A simple HTML / Javascript coded idle incremental game that I made out of desire to become a game designer.
You should know that I know nothing about coding or game design that I did not teach myself, so clean code and logical patterns will not be present.
Please feel free to make any changes that would make sense and as much creative criticism that you can dish out.
